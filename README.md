# Nicotine-Cotinine-Model
Whole-body PBPK/PD model of nicotine and cotinine

### Repository Files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK/PD model of nicotine and its major metabolite cotinine, that has been carefully built and evaluated for the prediction of nicotine and cotinine plasma concentrations, nicotine brain tissue concentrations, and heart rate profiles after nicotine intake.
The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model development, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, local sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [1].

### Version Information
PK-Sim Version 8.0
